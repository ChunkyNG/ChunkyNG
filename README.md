- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChunkyNG
- ðŸ‘€ Proper software has the capacity to make business easier. 

But right now there's a lot of high-level tools with sky-high costs, or subscription services that require businesses to change their processes to fit the solution.
I'm now investigating if there's a viable middle-ground, where the development of simpler solutions with less feature-bloat can be developed for SMEs.

I'm interested in learning about any technologies that save people time or effort at work, so they have more time to spend elsewhere.
To catch up with old friends, or make new ones. To pursure their hobbies and interests. Or even just more time to lie in bed in the mornings.

Always learning, but right now, am currently interested in: Web app development, with focus on Javascript & Vue.js, and RMDBs.
